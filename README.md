<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
Begin to triage support tickets by navigating to the Tickets tab. All the tickets that have been entered will appear on this tab and are organized by small drop down tabs: Open, My Tickets (tickets that are assigned to a specific support agent), Closed, and Search (to look up a specific ticket). Select a ticket and begin to triage by assigning the ticket to the appropriate department/team, and be sure to update the priority and SLA appropriately. For example, a ticket reporting a complete outage to the mobile banking system would fall under SEV-A as this issue would prevent the company from making money and would only cause more unhappy customers.

<p>
Once the ticket has been appropriately prioritized and assigned the support agent(s) can begin working towards a solution. The support agent(s) can also post replies to the ticket thread so the ticket has the most up to date information on the progress of the solution. In the case of a mobile banking outage the ticket would likely be transferred to a more capable team, such as System Administrators. Once a solution is found and the ticket is resolved, simply update the Ticket Status appropriately.

<p>
It's important to remember that not all problems are created equal. Ensuring that all tickets are appropriately assigned and organized will eliminate confusion and streamline efficiency. Customer service is a foundational pillar to any successful business and having streamlined workflows allows support agents to perform their jobs better and ultimately serve the customer better.
